	    <div class="entry">
	        <p>Many of you probably don't know but I am actually a member of the scout association and enjoy helping out at my "local" scout group. It is not really local group anymore as I went from living in Rossendale to Yorkshire and now Bury and 7th A is in Rochdale but I travel the extra distance because it is where my scouting history is.</p>

<p>Now up until 6months ago I attended regularly and would be available at most times to help out that was until I started at UKFast now as with all new jobs I let it slide that I couldn't make it down to 7th A twice a week but I feel now is the time to get back into it. With the rota I'm currently on I can get down for a couple of weeks (I currently work 4days on 4days off) but when I switch back to the usual rota this wouldn't be possible. Hopefully I can arrange to finish earlier on wed/thurs and work extra hours but that's up to my boss. I'm sure he will understand and maybe say yes!</p>

<p>So what's been happening recently?
Well I'm still working on there new site (yes still.. sorry) it's proving quite a challenge as I don't know 100% what platform they have at there web host, I have so many ideas but can't guarantee that there will be access to such basic things as a database (Not that this is a massive problem as I could just host a db for there site if really needed, I happen to work in hosting and have a bunch of servers sat doing nothing :-)). Currently it will be pretty much a static site but some things I'd like to implement (totally not even discussed, this is the first time they have come out of my head):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Monthly/Bi-Monthly newsletter that parents/friends can sign up to from the website - Manageable though an admin interface - Yeah I'd need a db for that :(</p></li>
<li><p>New stream on the website - Manageable though an admin interface - I'll need a db for that</p></li>
<li><p>Ideas/feedback form for website/group</p></li>
<li><p>Some interactive tour stuff of HQ</p></li>
<li><p>"Meet the leaders" page - Manageable though an admin interface - Yeah I'd need a db for that as well</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Loads of other stuff as well just all depends on how flexible the hosting is tbh, should have the site finished by the end of the month to a basic level though!</p>

<p>Other ideas I have include writing a decent management system for groups.</p>

<p>Slightly dull post, more fun things to come soon though I hope!</p>

	        <p>IT WAS AMAZING! No really it was probably the best 2 days of my entire life. It started out with AC/DC's last 2 songs (I went from work so missed the start) and ended with rain! I missed seeing a few bands that I really wanted to see but all the others were just amazing so I couldn't leave.</p>

<p>I am burnt to a crisp from the sun and battered from the mosh pits, tired from no sleep and cover in mud but it was all worth it! It was one of the most mental decisions made in the past few years, just days before it opened I got the tickets. With no planning at all and hardly any funds put to one side I set off for the weekend of my life. Only regrets are going alone and missing a friends 18th party, everything else was perfect. The most amazing things happened this weekend, the most noticeable was RATM.</p>

<p>RATM are the only band I have ever seen to fill the stage completely and have <em>everyone</em> jumping around just mins in, the security even stopped the music and asked everyone to move back! It was totally un-real, just feet from the front totally rocking it out. The only band I am really really really sad about missing are FlyLeaf, I have never seen them live and want too so badly. Found out they were on after it happened :'(</p>

<p>I can't even begin to describe what it was like, if you weren't there you don't know just think WOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! while jumping up and down and running around and into people!</p>

<p>So to round up it was 500000000000000000000% amazing and I will be going next year no matter what, I'll also be taking my best friend ever and swear I'll be dating someone by then. Lots shall change the only thing constant will be my love for music. Now to do some of that work I left at the weekend! Got loads of new bands to listen too while coding now though =D</p>

	        <p>So I'm currently working on a small project which will require authentication. Not really sure how to achieve what I want so here's a quick explanation for anyone if you want to share ideas:
Basic SQL definition:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">mysql&gt;; describe users;
+---------------------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

+---------------------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

| password | varchar<span class="o">(</span>100<span class="o">)</span> | NO | | NULL | |
| salt | varchar<span class="o">(</span>15<span class="o">)</span> | NO | | NULL | |

<p>For permissions I want to do groups but then have the option to override them on a per user basis. All permissions fields are named perm_ , in the users table there are the Y/N as options then G, if the field is G then it uses the identical permissions field from the group table that the user is part of (group_id matches up with id in the user_groups table).</p>

<p>Basic SQL idea:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">SELECT IF<span class="o">((</span><span class="sb">`</span>users<span class="sb">`</span>.<span class="sb">`</span>perm_test<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;G&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>, <span class="sb">`</span>user_groups<span class="sb">`</span>.<span class="sb">`</span>perm_test<span class="sb">`</span>, <span class="sb">`</span>users<span class="sb">`</span>.<span class="sb">`</span>perm_test<span class="sb">`</span><span class="o">)</span> AS allowed from users LEFT JOIN <span class="o">(</span><span class="sb">`</span>user_groups<span class="sb">`</span><span class="o">)</span> ON <span class="o">(</span><span class="sb">`</span>user_groups<span class="sb">`</span>.<span class="sb">`</span>id<span class="sb">`</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>users<span class="sb">`</span>.<span class="sb">`</span>group_id<span class="sb">`</span><span class="o">)</span> WHERE <span class="sb">`</span>users<span class="sb">`</span>.<span class="sb">`</span>username<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;testuser&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Now this works just fine however I can see issues mainly limitations to only being able to check one permission at a time. For 99% of the time this wouldn't be an issue for example when using the web interface/api there would be at a minimum of 2 calls and most of the time that would be it however in certain cases where you needed a full list there would be large issues. For a start getting a list of permissions would be highly recourse intensive and returning everyone would result in running something like the above for every permission. This may be a few hundred times per user per load.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of a way to move permissions into there own table then call them in a relational fashion but cannot think how to do this keeping the user/group system. Any ideas would be massively appreciated, for the moment db scheme changes are fine as this is very much a testing structure.</p>

<p>Speak to you soon :)</p>

<h1>Proprietary Projects</h1>

<h4>DNS Stats Collector</h4>

<p>Python based DNS sniffer, aimed at providing accurate DNS statistics on a per domain level.</p>

<p>Logic to aggregate record stats and provide zone related stats (zone/subdomain vs record) with time based collecting to a central store for graphing and accounting.</p>

<p>Handled >10 million DNS requests in POC stage with minimal issues.</p>

<h4>FSScanner</h4>

<p>Distributed file scanning service. Designed for shared hosting services to detect uploads that violate TOS (illegal software, large media files etc) based on policy.</p>

<p>Client/server design with hook based actions, allowing escalation via ticking systems or auto suspension.</p>

<p>POC deployment on 200 clients with 2 servers.</p>

<h4>Fork of Maldet</h4>

<p>Developed a custom version of malware detection software based on maldet for a hosting comapny.</p>

<p>Added multiple features that where required for their deployment, including heavily optimised multiprocessing.</p>

<h4>Hosting migration tools</h4>

<p>Developed a number of email and DNS migration tools for a company that was splitting away from its parent. Highly customised due to the source setup, migrated to a much more standard setup to improve on-going support.</p>

<p>Processed >15k DNS zones at the record level.</p>

<h4>Clook v2 portal/Vision 108 portal</h4>

<p>Developed integration with internal monitoring, auditing and ticketing systems for the Vision 108 portal. Expanded the admin side of the portal with a custom API and improved server side tools.</p>

<p>Enriched the client experience by providing always correct, up to date information about their services.</p>

<h4>clook.net</h4>

<p>Development of custom pages for the clook.net website and integration of wordpress into the bespoke php based engine. All pages are dynamic based on section (ie a single job advert can be made active or inactive by flipping a flag in the config).</p>

<p>Active use of the wordpress integration (http://www.clook.net/blog/) as well as other pages (http://www.clook.net/company/careers, http://www.clook.net/services/complex-solutions etc) continue to this day.</p>

<h4>Clook NOC</h4>

<p>Developed features for a custom Symfony v1.0 based "network operations center". Added support for software version tracking, forum integration, staff ip distribution, better auditing, automated password cycling (twice weekly), improved mass emailing support, tighter integration into the helpdesk (client lookup and marking un-authorised emails in red) to ensure compliance with security policies.</p>

<h4>FTP Enforcer</h4>

<p>Custom pureauth-wrapper based security system for FTP. Designed for Shared/Reseller cPanel based hosting servers.</p>

<p>Provides a cPanel and WHM interface, empowering end users and resellers alike to manage their FTP security.</p>

<p>Successfully deployed to around 100 servers and in active use.</p>

<h4>SpeedyWeb</h4>

<p>Flexible, lightweight Varnish integration for cPanel.</p>

<p>Aside from a few commercial options integrating Varnish with cPanel is rather clunky.</p>

<p>This plugin smoothed the whole process out and enabled end users to tweak caching rules.</p>

<p>Deployed to a handful of client servers, never feature complete enough for shared servers.</p>

<h4>Custom cPanel DNS module</h4>

<p>Custom cPanel DNS module to parse the original and new zone files, determine changes then relay to an API.</p>

<p>Enabled centralised tracking of DNS zones, auditing of record changes, association to clients and integration with the client portal and admin interfaces.</p>

<h4>Nagios notifier</h4>

<p>Nagios broker based notifier. Designed to aggregate monitoring events then relay them to a HTTP based API.</p>

<p>Enabled real time updating of status pages for clients, auditing of outage events, client specific rebates etc.</p>

<h4>DNS Cluster</h4>

<p>Redesigned the back end 'DNS cluster' software for CLOOK. Moved from a passive, custom apache vhost based system (which had multiple issues) to a server orientated system that could be actively interrogated for meta data as well as zones.</p>

<p>Reworked the collector to be multi-threaded and reduced collection intervals. Also introduced a 'diff' based update, based on zones and zone serial numbers. Removed SPOFs and migrated to a multiple collector based system, so each DNS server could act independently.</p>

<p>Also injected custom 'meta' records into the zones at the server level, enabling easy troubleshooting for support staff when looking at the live DNS servers</p>

<h4>TGT 'Backup' SAN</h4>

<p>Developed software for the automated management of TGT based iSCSI sans as part of an innovative to migrate away from Equal logics to more independent, cheaper units.</p>

<p>Deployed numerous Dell R720 based sans in a 'one per rack' configuration combined with blade centers, running the software.</p>

<h4>BFD</h4>

<p>Re-designed and existing tool to automatically detect and block brute force attacks against email services.</p>

<p>Configurable pattern based detection, supports Dovecot, Courier and Exim out the box.</p>

<p>Provided a simple command line interface to manage the blocks for helpdesk staff, hooks to notify the central NOC API of a block (so attacks against multiple targets could be blocked globally based...more</p>

<h4>WHM APF Manager</h4>

<p>WHM based plugin to manage the APF firewall package.</p>

<p>Designed to be simple and allow users to do what they need to (allow/block ips, open ports), but not change advanced features of the firewall.</p>

<h4>cPanel Dual/Triple stack PHP</h4>

<p>Developed a custom system (with cPanel interface) for selecting PHP 5.2, 5.3 or 5.4 as the active version.</p>

<p>Used in a shared hosting environment of about 60 servers to enable developers to run PHP 5.2 compatible apps while the default version on the server was PHP 5.3.</p>

<p>Achieved using suphp and custom application handlers. Interface in cPanel then updated .htaccess files to activate the correct handler.</p>

<h4>Email Depersonalizer</h4>

<p>An Exchange 2010 custom transport agent, designed to rewrite all inbound and outbound email from a persons email address to their distribution list (primary DL stored in pager field).</p>

<p>Functionality currently provided outbound by CodeTwo, which doesn't support Inbound rewriting and is rather quite flaky.</p>

<p>Never deployed outside of a test setup.</p>

<h4>Monitoring portal</h4>

<p>Custom 'dashboard' interface to Icinga. Also exposed current on-call contacts, link layer network topology, traffic graphs and other key information for first line help desk personal.</p>

<h4>Puppet reports</h4>

<p>Simple PHP based web interface for viewing puppet reports. Designed to be used with a sizeable set of puppet reports for helpdesk staff to drill in quickly.</p>

<h4>Thumbnail gallery post</h4>

<p>Designed and implemented a custom TGP framework composing of presentation, analytics and background processing modules.</p>

<p>Successfully deployed and used to create revenue from advertising spaces and affiliate site referrals.</p>

<h4>Bacula Meta Restore</h4>

<p>Developed a set of tools to restore meta data from Bacula. Main target focus was file permission/ownership information to aid in the fast restore of service post client 'accidents', without having to revert the file contents.</p>

<h4>Facebook Photos Userspace Filesystem</h4>

<p>Wrote a custom filesystem in userspace (FUSE) to expose Facebook photo albums locally, via the Facebook API.</p>

<p>Used to serve media from Facebook over the local network from a media server and simplify bulk uploading images.</p>

<h4>Openfire DL based roster</h4>

<p>Developed a bespoke roster management system for Openfire based on business requirements.</p>

<p>Using custom attributes in Active Directory, hundreds of arbitrary groups where calculated and stored for Openfire to serve.</p>

<h4>Email retention enforcement</h4>

<p>Developed a set of tools to forcibly remove emails (PST files) from desktop machines spread around the world, based on SCCM polling results.</p>

<p>Reported all removals/failures allowing a 'golden list' of outstanding files to be passed over to service desk staff for tracking down machines and manual removal.</p>

<p>Designed to run continuously without alerting users, until exec mandated requirements where met.</p>

<p>Also provided tools for checking which machines could be logged into remotely to enable pre-execution changes, such as re-enabling services via group policy.</p>

<h4>Load testing tools</h4>

<p>Built a set of tools to load test a HTTP based service in a repeatable manner.</p>

<p>Largely used JMeter - extended with its scripting interface - along with ApacheBench and a number of result processing tools.</p>

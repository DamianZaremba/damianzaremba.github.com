This will be the "top" of your burner.</p> <p>An easy way is to clip your knife onto the back of a book then score around the outside.</p> <p>Once you have a good score line take your saw and run it around to make a cut.</p> <p>Then after you have just the bottom of the can left take your file and smooth off the top. If need be use your scissors/knife to trim off any crap.</p> <h3>Step3</h3> <p>Now you need to make an inner wall which fits around the "dip" in your burners top.</p> <p>Slice down the side of the can (use the bit you just cut off) and remove the top of the can.</p> <p>You should be left with basically the body of the can (you may need to use another can depending how big you cut the top of your stove)</p> <p>Now roll it up to fit around the dip in your burners top and mark it with your knife.</p> <p>Take a pair of scissors and cut it down to size then tape both ends just to hold it in place.</p> <p>I taped it a little smaller than it needed to be then pushed it around the dip - this made a tight fit so the next step was easier.</p> <h3>Step4</h3> <p>Cut out some notches in the top of your inner wall - this will be where the fuel can flow though into the bottom of the burner.</p> <p>You should end up with a circle of notches sticking out the top of your burner top.</p> <h3>Step5</h3> <p>Now to make the burner bottom, take another empty can and measure it against your burner top.</p> <p>You want to make it about 1Â½ times the size of the burner top.</p> <p>This will fit over your burner top and make the base of the burner where the fuel flows into.</p> <h3>Step6</h3> <p>Now we need to fix the bottom to the top.</p> <p>You want to end up with your inner wall matching up with your little dip in the bottom of the burner as you did with the top.</p> <p>You can use a spare piece of the side to help you ease the cans together.</p> <p>You should get a really tight fit - I had to cut down and file off the outer can after as I did the measuring wrong.</p> <p>Now you should basically have a can with an inner can - You put the fuel in the middle and it flows down to the bottom of the can where you can light it.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <p>I've seen a few other people's stoves and they seem to cut them down to just under 2".</p> <p>Mine ended up slightly bigger as can be seen below. I'm not sure how this will affect its performance but it should produce a better cooking height.</p> <p><img src="/2011/06/meth-stove/IMG_0358-225x300.jpg" alt=""/> <img src="/2011/06/meth-stove/IMG_0359-225x300.jpg" alt=""/></p> <p>Another thing that was done differently was the number of burners - this will probably use more fuel but should produce a larger heat.</p> <h3>Other</h3> <p>I'm going to light this on Thursday and see if it works fine - It might explode or work fine. I think I slightly crimped the inner wall while fitting it together.</p> <p>If it works fine I'll probably build another and document it better else I'll do a design review. As long as my phone doesn't die on me I'll try to get a video of lighting it which could turn out quite funny...</p> <p>Update: The stove didn't work very well - upon lighting it the meths burnt off in a big puff of singed hair and wouldn't turn into anything more.</p> <p>I'm guessing the holes where too big causes a massive rush of oxygen into the fuel "store" and it burning off very quickly.</p> <p>I'll have another go at building one some time soon as I burnt this attempted (we had a reasonably sized fire, what else would you do) and let you know if it turns out any better.</p> </div> </article> <section id=related> <h2>Related posts</h2> <ul id=related_posts> <li>&raquo; <a href="/2014/08/quick-look-at-upgrading-to-centos-7/">A very quick look at upgrading CentOS 6.5 to 7.0</a></li> <li>&raquo; <a href="/2013/01/what-is-anycast-and-why-would-i-use-it/">What's Anycast and why would I use it?</a></li> <li>&raquo; <a href="/2012/09/slow-ssh-to-new-centos-servers/">Slow SSH to new CentOS servers</a></li> </ul> </section> <section id=comment> <h2>Comments</h2> <div id=disqus_thread aria-live=polite> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments</noscript> </div> </section> <script type="text/javascript">var disqus_identifier="http://damianzaremba.co.uk/2011/06/meth-stove/";var disqus_url="http://damianzaremba.co.uk/2011/06/meth-stove/";(function(){var a=document.createElement("script");a.type="text/javascript";a.async=true;a.src="http://damianzaremba.disqus.com/embed.js";(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]).appendChild(a)}());</script> </div> <footer class=footer> <div class=container> <p class=text-muted>Copyright 2009-2015 <a href="http://damianzaremba.co.uk">Damian Zaremba</a></p> <ul id=ads> <li>Need error logging?

    <div class="entry">
        <p>I saw pretty cool stove the other day and decided to have a go at it.</p>

<p>The final stove was a little messy but <em>should</em> work fine - I'm going to test it on Thursday and see if it works or not.</p>

<p><img src="/2011/06/meth-stove/IMG_0356-225x300.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some notes before starting that I found out the hard way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be careful once you start making cuts - You end up with tiny bits of metal that are <em>very</em> sharp.</li>
<li>File off the edges - It makes the metal easier to work with and stops you from slicing your fingers open.</li>
<li>Measure the height of your inner wall - It makes fitting the thing together much easier.</li>
<li>Don't slice down the side of the can when scoring off the bottoms - This makes it easier to get the bottoms off but means you need a spare can for the inner.</li>
<li>Be careful when making the holes in the top - I started out with a pin that made nice round holes then broke it so used a knife that made much bigger "slots".</li>
<li>When rolling your inner wall use a bit of tape - it will burn off later.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to</h2>

<p>First you are going to need:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 x Empty drinks cans</li>
<li>1 x Very sharp knife</li>
<li>1 x File</li>
<li>1 x Saw (You could use your knife but a saw makes it easier)</li>
<li>1 pair of scissors (Once again you could use your knife but this makes it easier)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step1</h3>

<p>Firstly take 1 empty can and turn it upside down so the end <em>without</em> a hole is at the top for you to work on.</p>

<p>Carefully punch a bunch of holes around the outside for burners and a few holes right in the middle for filling.</p>

<p>Make sure not to put the middle holes too close to the outside - you need enough space for the middle wall to separate the fuel.</p>

<p>You should end up with something like this...</p>

<p><img src="/2011/06/meth-stove/IMG_0357.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>Step2</h3>

<p>Next you need to cut off the bottom of the can (the actual bottom, where you just made holes in). This will be the "top" of your burner.</p>

<p>An easy way is to clip your knife onto the back of a book then score around the outside.</p>

<p>Once you have a good score line take your saw and run it around to make a cut.</p>

<p>Then after you have just the bottom of the can left take your file and smooth off the top. If need be use your scissors/knife to trim off any crap.</p>

<h3>Step3</h3>

<p>Now you need to make an inner wall which fits around the "dip" in your burners top.</p>

<p>Slice down the side of the can (use the bit you just cut off) and remove the top of the can.</p>

<p>You should be left with basically the body of the can (you may need to use another can depending how big you cut the top of your stove)</p>

<p>Now roll it up to fit around the dip in your burners top and mark it with your knife.</p>

<p>Take a pair of scissors and cut it down to size then tape both ends just to hold it in place.</p>

<p>I taped it a little smaller than it needed to be then pushed it around the dip - this made a tight fit so the next step was easier.</p>

<h3>Step4</h3>

<p>Cut out some notches in the top of your inner wall - this will be where the fuel can flow though into the bottom of the burner.</p>

<p>You should end up with a circle of notches sticking out the top of your burner top.</p>

<h3>Step5</h3>

<p>Now to make the burner bottom, take another empty can and measure it against your burner top.</p>

<p>You want to make it about 1Â½ times the size of the burner top.</p>

<p>This will fit over your burner top and make the base of the burner where the fuel flows into.</p>

<h3>Step6</h3>

<p>Now we need to fix the bottom to the top.</p>

<p>You want to end up with your inner wall matching up with your little dip in the bottom of the burner as you did with the top.</p>

<p>You can use a spare piece of the side to help you ease the cans together.</p>

<p>You should get a really tight fit - I had to cut down and file off the outer can after as I did the measuring wrong.</p>

<p>Now you should basically have a can with an inner can - You put the fuel in the middle and it flows down to the bottom of the can where you can light it.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p>I've seen a few other people's stoves and they seem to cut them down to just under 2".</p>

<p>Mine ended up slightly bigger as can be seen below. I'm not sure how this will affect its performance but it should produce a better cooking height.</p>

<p><img src="/2011/06/meth-stove/IMG_0358-225x300.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="/2011/06/meth-stove/IMG_0359-225x300.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Another thing that was done differently was the number of burners - this will probably use more fuel but should produce a larger heat.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p>I'm going to light this on thursday and see if it works fine - It might explode or work fine. I think I slightly crimped the inner wall while fitting it together.</p>

<p>If it works fine I'll probably build another and document it better else I'll do a design review. As long as my phone doesn't die on me I'll try to get a video of lighting it which could turn out quite funny...</p>

<p>Update:
The stove didn't work very well - upon lighting it the meths burnt off in a big puff of singed hair and wouldn't turn into anything more.</p>

<p>I'm guessing the holes where too big causes a massive rush of oxygen into the fuel "store" and it burning off very quickly.</p>

<p>I'll have another go at building one some time soon as I burnt this attempted (we had a reasonably sized fire, what else would you do) and let you know if it turns out any better.</p>
